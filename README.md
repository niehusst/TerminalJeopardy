# Terminal Jeopardy!

The version of Jeopardy!â„¢ you will die for (and can be played on the command line).
This game uses the C socket API to created a distributed TCP network across which multiple users on different computers can play.

## Getting Started

To play a game of Terminal Jeopardy! you need to do a few quick things. First, make the executables by invoking `make` or `make all` on the command line. Then, the server must be started up so that players can begin to connect. Do this by running `./server`. This should result in an output a little like:
```
Server listening on port 53651
```
That port number is important for the clients, as it is how they will connect with the server. Each person who wants to play must then run the client executable, giving as command line arguments their desired username for the game, the hostname of the computer running the server (if you don't know this off-hand, it can be obtained by invoking the command `hostname` on the machine) and the port number printed by the server. That might look something like:
```
./client Timmy hostname 53651
```
Until all the players have connected, the game will not start and each client will be told that not enough players have connected yet (the current default is 4 players, however that can be adjusted by changing the macro in `game_structs.h`). Once the required number of clients have connect, the game will begin and the board of questions will be printed in each client's terminal. From here, the game is relatively self-explanitory, starting with the player whose turn it is selecting the question for the first round.

**NOTE:** This program was developed to work on UNIX-like operating systems (Linux and MacOS) so I cannot say whether it is fully functional on Microsoft platforms.
